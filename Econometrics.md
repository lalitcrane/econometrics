Other Books.

1. Greene: One of the most comprehensive but most confusing books in econometrics. This book can get very hard very quickly. I find the notation weird somehow. Only towards the end of my PhD I begin appreciating some of the chapters/comments of this book, it's a very valuable book. But, I definitely don't suggest you to begin with this book.

2. Wooldridge: A well-written book and easy to understand/read. However, it is written too much from a 'microeconometrician's perspective. And some of its notation is confusing. The theory level is low. Hence, you can perceive the level somewhere between undergrad and grad.

3. Hayashi: I worship this book, in particular the first three chapters! They are the best chapters for a grad level introduction for econometrics. The theory level is very good, the notation is very consistent and well-designed. The only requirement is being comfortable with matrices. If your Linear Algebra knowledge isn't good enough, or if you get scared when you see matrices floating around, then forget about Hayashi's book.
